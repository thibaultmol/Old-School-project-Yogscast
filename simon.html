Often seen as the most important person of the yogscast crew.
His IGN (In Game Name) is honeydew and he plays a dwarf as soon as he can.
Simon usually is the more entertaining person in the crew while Lewis is the more intelligent person. Simon also sings in a few songs mostly made for yognauts ( how they call their fans).
Simon likes Jaffa Cakes and is very easily distracted by cute creatures. Not much is known of simon’s background.</p>
